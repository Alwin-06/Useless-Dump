# Naadan Useless Dump 🎯

### Project Description
A totally overengineered yet proudly useless app that evaluates your naadan (Kerala-style) identity using simple image processing, random logic, and bad life advice. From measuring vada holes to calculating your love chances, it delivers zero value — but full laughs.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today’s fast-moving digital world, no one is asking:

“Is my parippu vada symmetrical enough?”

“How kanappi do I look in this selfie?”

“Will she say yes if I open up my feelings?”

This app proudly solves these deeply unnecessary questions using pure nonsense and computer vision wizardry.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We combined random name generators, absurd logic, and image processing filters to deliver judgments no one requested. Want to know your vada’s hole score or pappadam's circularity? Just upload a pic — we’ll roast it like a thattukada uncle. Also includes a love meter that works worse than your crush’s replies.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages Used:

Python 🐍

- Frameworks Used:

Streamlit (for the UI)

- Libraries Used:

OpenCV (for image processing of vadas and pappadams)

random (for fake love meter and kanappi score)

numpy (for shape analysis)

- Tools Used:

VS Code

Your deep sense of time-wasting creativity

For Hardware:
- Main Components:

A potato-quality webcam (for selfies and vada pics)

A working brain with a questionable sense of purpose
- Specifications:

Device: Any laptop that hasn’t overheated yet

Internet: For Streamlit and memes
- Tools Required:

Your friend to take a vada pic while you pretend it’s research

Light source, preferably not a tubelight from a tea shop

### Implementation
For Software:
This fun and absolutely unnecessary app is built using Python and Streamlit. It’s structured into multiple useless modules that do one job: waste your time in a funny way.

Each section uses either random logic or quirky image processing techniques to produce a laughably detailed result. Here's what powers each tab:

- 📛 **Naadan Nickname Generator** – Uses randomization to turn your name into a Kerala-style “pet name”.
- 🔥 **Kanappi Score Meter** – Uses OpenCV to read a selfie and throw a totally unscientific score.
- ❤️ **Naadan Proposal Success Meter** – Takes two names and gives random percentage-based love advice with naadan flavor.
- 🍘 **Vada Hole Analyzer** – Counts how many holes are in your parippu vada image using contour detection.
- 🔵 **Pappadam Roundness Index** – Calculates how round your pappadam is using image circularity logic.
- 🌀 **Vada Symmetry Analyzer** – Tells you how close your vada is to being perfectly round... or a UFO.

# Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/naadan-vibes.git
cd naadan-vibes

# 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run
streamlit run app.py

### 📄 Project Documentation

#### For Software

**Overview:**

**Naadan Vibes** is a playful web app built with **Streamlit** that combines 6 hilarious, “useless but clever” modules inspired by Kerala's local flavor. From Kanappi score predictions to an overcomplicated login system, the app delivers pure entertainment with a local twist.

**Structure:**

* `app.py`: Main router for navigating features.
* `modules/`: Contains each feature as a separate Python file.
* `assets/`: Holds images, emojis, sound files, and styles.
* `utils/`: Shared helper functions (e.g., random score generator, image analysis).

**Key Functionalities:**

1. **Kanappi Score Predictor** – Uses a mock ML model to rate your “kanappi” level from a selfie.
2. **Love Proposal Success Meter** – Generates a funny, random love compatibility score.
3. **Virtual Standing Guy** – Displays a static “guy” with changing sarcastic status texts.
4. **Naadan Random Talks** – Spits out randomly generated naadan-style jokes and dialogues.
5. **Naadan Nickname Generator** – Gives a comically accurate nickname from your name/selfie.
6. **Complicated Login System** – A 3-step login with puzzles, face detection & Morse password.

**How It Works:**

Each module runs independently in Streamlit pages. Random logic and optional image processing mimic ML behavior. User input is collected via forms or uploads and responses are styled with emojis and dark mode.

**Limitations:**

* ML usage is minimal or mock-based.
* All outputs are humorous and non-scientific.
* Designed for fun, not function.

**Future Fun Ideas:**

* Add voice input/output for nickname or proposal modules.
* Include “Naadan Avatar Creator.”
* Gamify the Complicated Login with points 🕹️

The “Oru Naadan Proposal Success Meter” module asks for your name and your crush’s name to predict your love proposal success—Naadan style! A fun take on traditional love calculators with a desi twist.

### 📊 Workflow Description:

The user begins by accessing the **Naadan Vibes** homepage. From there, they can choose among six unique features:

1. **Kanappi Score Predictor**: The user uploads a selfie, and a machine learning model analyzes visual features like hairstyle, piercings, and outfit to generate a humorous “kanappi” score.
2. **Love Proposal Success Meter**: By entering their name and their crush’s name, the user gets a playful “naadan-style” love success prediction.
3. **Virtual Standing Guy**: Once accessed, it displays a funny idle character that says random “still standing” type messages.
4. **Oru Naadan Random Talks**: Clicking this generates humorous, AI-crafted random dialogues or statements mimicking a typical naadan person.
5. **Naadan Nickname Generator**: Based on the user’s input or selfie, the system gives them a comical nickname using visual or text clues.
6. **Complicated Login System**: An intentionally overengineered 3-step login process featuring a Rubik’s cube challenge, funny face detection, and Morse code password entry.

Each module is independent, offering an engaging and humorous experience tailored to the “naadan” theme. Once completed, users can loop back to explore another feature.

This Streamlit-based web app is a hilarious collection of completely unnecessary but undeniably entertaining features rooted in pure Kerala vibes. It includes an Appam Hole Counter and a Vada Hole Size Analyzer using image processing to judge your culinary skills like your nosy aunties do, while the Pappadam Roundness Index ensures your crispy snack meets circular perfection. The Naadan Nickname Generator uses randomization and Malayali slang to give you the nickname you never asked for, and the Proposal Success Meter calculates your love fate using absolutely no real science (but 100% emotion). Finally, the app is hidden behind a ridiculously Overcomplicated Login System involving face detection, Rubik's cube references, and Morse code—because why not make access harder than a government exam? All features come wrapped in funny visuals and background meme music to make your useless journey worthwhile.
