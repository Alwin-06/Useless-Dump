# Naadan Useless Dump 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Glitch


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Alwin Philip - RIT Kottayam
- Member 2: Edwin Varkey - RIT Kottayam

### Project Description
A totally overengineered yet proudly useless app that evaluates your naadan (Kerala-style) identity using simple image processing, random logic, and bad life advice. From measuring vada holes to calculating your love chances, it delivers zero value — but full laughs.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today’s fast-moving digital world, no one is asking:

“Is my parippu vada symmetrical enough?”

“How kanappi do I look in this selfie?”

“Will she say yes if I open up my feelings?”

This app proudly solves these deeply unnecessary questions using pure nonsense and computer vision wizardry.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We combined random name generators, absurd logic, and image processing filters to deliver judgments no one requested. Want to know your vada’s hole score or pappadam's circularity? Just upload a pic — we’ll roast it like a thattukada uncle. Also includes a love meter that works worse than your crush’s replies.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages Used:

Python 🐍

- Frameworks Used:

Streamlit (for the UI)

- Libraries Used:

OpenCV (for image processing of vadas and pappadams)

random (for fake love meter and kanappi score)

numpy (for shape analysis)

- Tools Used:

VS Code

Your deep sense of time-wasting creativity

For Hardware:
- Main Components:

A potato-quality webcam (for selfies and vada pics)

A working brain with a questionable sense of purpose
- Specifications:

Device: Any laptop that hasn’t overheated yet

Internet: For Streamlit and memes
- Tools Required:

Your friend to take a vada pic while you pretend it’s research

Light source, preferably not a tubelight from a tea shop

### Implementation
For Software:
This fun and absolutely unnecessary app is built using Python and Streamlit. It’s structured into multiple useless modules that do one job: waste your time in a funny way.

Each section uses either random logic or quirky image processing techniques to produce a laughably detailed result. Here's what powers each tab:

- 📛 **Naadan Nickname Generator** – Uses randomization to turn your name into a Kerala-style “pet name”.
- 🔥 **Kanappi Score Meter** – Uses OpenCV to read a selfie and throw a totally unscientific score.
- ❤️ **Naadan Proposal Success Meter** – Takes two names and gives random percentage-based love advice with naadan flavor.
- 🍘 **Vada Hole Analyzer** – Counts how many holes are in your parippu vada image using contour detection.
- 🔵 **Pappadam Roundness Index** – Calculates how round your pappadam is using image circularity logic.
- 🌀 **Vada Symmetry Analyzer** – Tells you how close your vada is to being perfectly round... or a UFO.

The “Oru Naadan Proposal Success Meter” module asks for your name and your crush’s name to predict your love proposal success—Naadan style! A fun take on traditional love calculators with a desi twist.
